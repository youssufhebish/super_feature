## Super Feature Brick with Cubit Pattern

This Mason brick helps you scaffold a feature with a Cubit state management pattern, adhering to a well-organized directory structure.

### Features

* Generates a complete feature structure with separate directories for controllers (Cubits and states), data (models and repositories), and views (including components).
* Includes basic boilerplate code for each component, promoting separation of concerns and testability.

### Usage

1. Install the `mason` package:

```bash
dart pub add mason
```

2. Use the `mason new` command to create a new feature:

```bash
mason new super_feature <feature_name>
```

Replace `<feature_name>` with the desired name for your feature (e.g., `login_feature`).

This will generate a directory structure like this:

```
<feature_name>/
├── lib/
│   ├── controller/
│   │   └── <feature_name_cubit>.dart
│   │   └── <feature_name_state>.dart
│   ├── data/
│   │   └── model/
│   │       └── <model_name>.dart (e.g., login_model.dart)
│   │   └── repo/
│   │       └── <feature_name_repo>.dart
│   └── views/
│       └── components/
│           └── <feature_name_body.dart>
│       └── <feature_name>.dart (e.g., login_view.dart)
└── pubspec.yaml
```

**Note:** Replace `<model_name>`, `<feature_name_cubit>`, `<feature_name_state>`, and `<feature_name_repo>` with appropriate names for your feature.

### Customization

- **Models:** Define your data structures in the `data/model` directory (e.g., `login_model.dart`). This file will typically contain properties and methods specific to your feature's data.
- **Repositories:** Implement data access logic in the `data/repo` directory (e.g., `login_feature_repo.dart`). Repositories interact with data sources (APIs, databases, etc.) to fetch and manage data.
- **Cubits (Controllers):** Manage state and business logic in the `controller` directory (e.g., `login_feature_cubit.dart`). Cubits expose streams for the current state and methods to emit new states based on user interactions or events.
- **States:** Define the state objects for your feature in the `controller` directory (e.g., `login_feature_state.dart`). These objects represent the different states your feature can be in, holding relevant data for the UI.
- **Views (Widgets):** Create your UI components in the `views` directory.
    - Use the `views/<feature_name>.dart` file (e.g., `login_view.dart`) for the main feature view.
    - Consider using the `views/components` directory for reusable UI components specific to your feature.

### Testing

The generated structure should be conducive to writing unit tests for your controllers, models, and repositories. Remember to write tests for your Cubits and state objects as well.

### Additional Notes

- This brick provides a foundation for building features with the Cubit state management pattern. You can further customize the implementation based on your project's needs.
- Consider using a dependency injection framework like Provider or GetIt to manage dependencies between your controllers, repositories, and views.

By leveraging this `super_feature` brick, you can establish a well-structured and testable foundation for your Flutter features, promoting maintainability and cleaner code separation.
