Initial Release (v0.1.0)
This is the first public release of the super_feature Mason brick. It provides a starting point for building features with the Cubit state management pattern in Flutter.

Features:

Generates a complete feature structure with separate directories for controllers (Cubits and states), data (models and repositories), and views (including components).
Includes basic boilerplate code for each component, promoting separation of concerns and testability.
Known Issues:

None reported at this time.
Future Considerations:

Support for additional state management solutions (e.g., Provider, Riverpod).
More advanced boilerplate code for features with complex requirements.
Unit test templates for different components.
We welcome your feedback and contributions to improve this brick!
